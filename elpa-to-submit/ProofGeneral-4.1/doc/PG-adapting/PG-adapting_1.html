<p>Welcome to Proof General!
</p>
<p>Proof General a generic Emacs-based interface for proof assistants.
</p>
<p>This manual contains information for adapting Proof General to new proof
assistants, and some sketches of the internal implementation.  It is not
intended for most ordinary users of the system.  
For full details about how to use Proof General, and information on its
availability and installation, please see the main Proof General manual
which should accompany this one.
</p>
<p>We positively encourage the support of new systems.  Proof General has
grown more flexible and useful as it has been adapted to more proof
assistants.  
</p>
<p>Typically, adding support for a new prover improves support for others,
both because the code becomes more robust, and because new ideas are
brought into the generic setting.  Notice that the Proof General
framework has been built as a &quot;product line architecture&quot;: generality
has been introduced step-by-step in a demand-driven way, rather than at
the outset as a grand design.  Despite this strategy, the interface has
a surprisingly clean structure.  The approach means that we fully expect
hiccups when adding support for new assistants, so the generic core may
need extension or modification.  To support this we have an open
development method: if you require changes in the generic support,
please contact us (or make adjustments yourself and send them to us).
</p>
<p>Proof General has a home page at
<a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk">http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk</a>.  Visit this page

downloads, etc.

<p>The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful and
configurable interfaces which help user-interaction with interactive
proof assistants.  
</p>
<p>The strategy Proof General uses is to targets power users rather than
novices; other interfaces have often neglected this class of users.  But
we do include general user interface niceties, such as toolbar and
menus, which make use easier for all.
</p>
<p>Proof General has been Emacs based so far, but plans are afoot to
liberate it from the points and parentheses of Emacs Lisp.  The
successor project Proof General Kit proposes that proof assistants use a
<i>standard</i> XML-based protocol for interactive proof, dubbed <b>PGIP</b>.
</p>
<p>PGIP enables middleware for interactive proof tools and interface
components.  Rather than configuring Proof General for your proof
assistant, you will need to configure your proof assistant to understand
PGIP.  There is a similarity however; the design of PGIP was based
heavily on the Emacs Proof General framework.  This means that effort on
customizing Emacs Proof General to a new proof assistant is worthwhile
even in the light of PGIP: it will help you to understand Proof
General&rsquo;s model of interaction, and moreover, we hope to use the Emacs
customizations to provide experimental filters which allow supported
provers to communicate using PGIP.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, these ideas are in early stages. For latest
details, or to become involved, see

<p>David Aspinall put together and wrote most of this manual.  Thomas
Kleymann wrote some of the text in Chapter 8.  Much of the content is
generated automatically from Emacs docstrings, some of which have been
written by other Proof General developers.
